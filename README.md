# Members Only

Live app can be visited [here](https://pure-earth-34113.herokuapp.com/).

**Member password:** `wholovesorangesoda`

**Admin password hint:** _Response to member password._

### Brief

This app is my submission to the Odin Project's Members Only assignment, which forms part of the NodeJS course. The assignment exercises what had been learned about user authentication, security and database manipulation. (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/members-only).

### Features

- Non-users can view all messages, however all messages appear anonymous until they register.
- Registered users and see the usernames of all other participants who have posted messages.
- Users can upgrade to 'member' status if they know the password.
- There is also an 'admin' status which can be gained from entering the admin password in the membership area. Admins can delete messages.
